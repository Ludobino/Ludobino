Hi, I am Gabriel Nunes
A FRON-END developer constantly studying, passionate about technology.
I'm always challenging myself with new projects and seeking feedbacks from the programming community, as well as sharing my knowledge. 😁
Ah, also I am a big fan of art(in general), games, movies, series & animes. 💜
